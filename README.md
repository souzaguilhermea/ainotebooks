# Jupyter Artificial Intelligence Notebooks
My python notebooks related to artificial intelligence (NLP, NN, Image Recognition, etc).  
If the project is big it will have an separed folder and readme, if it's in the main dir it's related to fundamentals, testing, etc.  
## SentimentIntensityAnalyzer (SIA Project)
In this project I study the usage of the SentimentIntensityAnalyzer and plotting some graphs for comparison.
